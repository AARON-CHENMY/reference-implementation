# IoT Reference Implementation: How to Build an Environment Monitor Solution

This guide demonstrates how existing IoT solutions can be adapted to address more complex problems (e.g., solutions that require more sensor monitoring). The solution we present here, an Environment Monitor, incorporates additional hardware and extends the use of IoT software libraries (sensors and I/O). Also, the solution has been adapted so the gateway can work with multiple operating systems.
