# IoT Reference Implementation: How to Build an Environment Monitor Solution

This how-to guide is part of an IoT (Internet of Things) series that investigates how novel solutions can be created with lower investments in both cost and
time than would otherwise be possible by drawing on pre-existing IoT projects. The Environment Monitor solution is an adaptation of an IoT project developed
by an Intel team - an Air Quality Sensor implementation.
